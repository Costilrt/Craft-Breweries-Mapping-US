# Craft-Breweries-Mapping-US

This project is an interactive map of craft breweries in the US. The dataset from kaggle and webscaped the BeerAdvocate Website, cleaned and combined/merged the dataset to a js file which is located in the Resources folder of this repository. The dataset was plotted on a chloropleth map showing the Brewery Name, Beer Name, Beer Style, and the Overall Review in every city. I also used API to plot breweries. The interactive map can be viewed in street view, satellite view, and dark view. This project is composed of HTML, JavaScipt, CSS, and PowerPoint Presentation.
